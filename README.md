 "Slot Machine Game" is an engaging Python project that simulates the experience of playing a slot machine. The project allows users to interactively deposit an initial balance, place bets on multiple lines, and spin the virtual slot machine reels. The game incorporates the following features:

Deposit: Users start by depositing an initial amount, which serves as their balance to place bets.

Betting: Players can choose the number of lines they want to bet on, within the range of 1 to a maximum of 3 lines. They can also specify the bet amount per line, ensuring it falls between the allowed minimum and maximum bet values.

Spinning: After placing their bets, users can spin the slot machine reels. The game generates random combinations of symbols across the rows and columns of the virtual reels.

Winning Calculation: The project employs a predefined set of symbols with associated counts and values. If the symbols on the selected lines align in a winning combination, players receive payouts based on the values assigned to those symbols.

Balance Management: The game dynamically updates the player's balance based on the bets placed and the winnings earned from successful spins.

Interactive Gameplay: The user interface guides players through the process, displaying their current balance, bet information, and the generated slot machine reels.

Quit Option: Players can choose to continue spinning the reels or exit the game at any time. Exiting the game displays the remaining balance.

"LuckyReels" offers an interactive and enjoyable experience, capturing the excitement of playing a slot machine without real money involvement. It demonstrates core programming concepts such as user input, randomization, conditional statements, loops, and modular design. The project showcases your ability to create a functional and entertaining simulation of a casino game using Python programming.
